## Visualizing-US-Natural-Disaster-Declarations

### Problem Statement

Natural disasters occur frequently across the United States, but understanding patterns, affected regions, and assistance programs is challenging due to the volume and complexity of raw data.
This project aims to analyze FEMA disaster declaration data and present clear, actionable insights through effective dashboards.

### Dataset Description [About Dataset]

FEMA disaster declaration data covering U.S. disaster events, including dates, locations, incident types, and assistance program indicators. The dataset was cleaned and prepared for accurate analysis and visualization.

##### Key information in the dataset:

1 . Disaster declaration dates

2 . Affected states and regions

3 . Incident and designated incident types

4 . Disaster identification details

5 . Assistance program declarations

##### Program declaration indicators included:

1 . Individual Assistance

2. Public Assistance

3 .Hazard Mitigation

4 .Emergency / Other Programs

### Key Performance Indicators [KPIs]
