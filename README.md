🌪️ Visualizing U.S. Natural Disaster Declarations

FEMA Data Analytics Dashboard | Trends, Hotspots & Program Impact

📌 Problem Statement

Understanding natural disaster patterns in the U.S. is difficult because FEMA data is large, unstructured, and spread across multiple attributes like dates, locations, incident types, and assistance programs. This project converts raw FEMA disaster declaration data into clear, interactive Power BI dashboards that help identify high-risk states, changing disaster trends over time, and resource-intensive disaster types to support better preparedness and planning.

📊 Dataset Description

This project uses FEMA Disaster Declaration Summary Data, containing historical records of federally declared disasters across U.S. states and territories. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to enable accurate analysis of time trends, geographic patterns, and incident types.

Key fields used in dashboards:

Declaration Date, Incident Begin & End Date

State, Designated Area

Incident Type (Flood, Hurricane, Fire, Storm, etc.)

Disaster Number & Declaration Type

Program Indicators (IA, PA, HM, Emergency)

Assistance Programs Analyzed:

Individual Assistance (IA)

Public Assistance (PA)

Hazard Mitigation (HM)

Emergency / Other Programs

🎯 Key KPIs (From Dashboards)

Total Disaster Declarations – overall disaster volume

Disasters by Incident Type – most frequent disaster categories

State-wise Disaster Count – hotspot identification

Year-wise Disaster Trend – growth or decline over time

Longest Disaster Duration (Days) – prolonged-impact events

Top 5 States vs Others – concentration of disaster risk

Program Usage Frequency – IA vs PA vs HM comparison

🔍 Key Insights (From Your Dashboards)

A small group of states repeatedly appear as disaster hotspots, requiring priority preparedness planning.

Floods, storms, and hurricanes dominate declarations, showing weather-driven risk patterns.

Disaster declarations show a long-term increasing trend, indicating rising climate-related impacts.

Top 5 states contribute a major share of total disasters, proving risk is concentrated, not evenly distributed.

Long-duration disasters are fewer but consume more recovery time and resources.

Public Assistance and Individual Assistance programs are most frequently declared, highlighting heavy infrastructure and citizen support needs.

Certain incident types show strong regional clustering (e.g., coastal hurricanes, western wildfires).
