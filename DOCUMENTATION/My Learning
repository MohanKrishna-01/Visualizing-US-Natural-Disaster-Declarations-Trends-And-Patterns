Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations using FEMA Dataset

This repository documents my week-wise internship work based on the Excel input dataset and project guidelines PDF, focusing on data cleaning, EDA, and visualization using Power BI.

-> Week 1 – Dataset Import & Data Cleaning [Power BI]

Objective:
To clean and prepare the FEMA Excel dataset for visualization.

Work Done:

-> Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI

-> Cleaned unnecessary columns and missing values

-> Converted Date-Time fields to Date format

-> Standardized column names and categorical values

Outcome:
Clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

-> Week 2 – Data Validation & Preparation (Python)

Objective:
To validate the FEMA dataset and ensure consistency.

Work Done:

-> Loaded the Excel dataset in Jupyter Notebook

-> Checked data structure, data types, and missing values

-> Verified data consistency with Power BI

Outcome:
Verified and reliable dataset for further work.

-> Week 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Power BI

Objective:
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the FEMA dataset using Power BI.

Work Done:

-> Analyzed disaster declaration trends over time

-> Explored program-wise and state-wise distributions

-> Used basic visuals to identify patterns and variations

-> Perform EDA For Netflix Dataset

Outcome:
Clear understanding of data patterns to support dashboard creation.

-> Week 4 – Live Data, Zendesk & ETL Concepts

Objective:
To understand real-world data integration and workflows.

Work Done:

-> Learned to import live data using web URLs in Power BI

-> Discussed Zendesk as an example of live data source

-> Studied ETL pipeline concepts (Extract, Transform, Load)

Outcome:
Understanding of enterprise-level data flow and dashboard integration.
