This dataset contains FEMA disaster declaration records for the United States, including disaster dates, affected locations, incident types, and program declaration indicators.
The raw data includes common real-world issues such as missing values, inconsistent categorical entries, redundant metadata columns, and DateTime fields with unnecessary time components.
These issues were addressed during preprocessing to prepare the data for accurate analysis and visualization.
